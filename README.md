## Why angle-builder?

Building the ANGLE library manually can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task, 
demanding substantial disk space and several minutes on a performant laptop.

Recognizing these challenges, we developed `angle-builder` mainly with CI/CD in mind, even though
it can be used on your own development machine.

## Key features

- **Simplified Build Process**: Our tool automates the intricate steps involved in building the ANGLE library, making it easy for developers to integrate into their workflow.
- **Binaries Consolidation for Apple Platforms**: `angle-builder` includes scripts to merge the generated binaries into a single one for Apple platforms, when applicable. This results in a fat .dylib for macOS and an .xcframework for iOS for `-universal` targets.
- **CI/CD Integration**: We use GitHub Actions to build the library and store the binaries for later use. This allows us to avoid the time-consuming and resource-intensive build process on each CI/CD run, or on each developer's machine.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the package:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kivy/angle-builder.git
$ cd angle-builder
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install .
```

## Usage

### Building ANGLE via ``angle-builder``

The following targets are available:
- `macos-x64`: Creates a zip file containing `libEGL.dylib`, `libGLESv2.dylib`, the `include` folder, and the `LICENSE` file for Intel-based macs.
- `macos-arm64`: Creates a zip file containing `libEGL.dylib`, `libGLESv2.dylib`, the `include` folder, and the `LICENSE` file for Apple Silicon macs.
- `macos-universal`: Creates a zip file containing `libEGL.dylib`, `libGLESv2.dylib`, the `include` folder, and the `LICENSE` file for Intel-based and Apple Silicon macs, by merging the binaries generated by the `macos-x64` and `macos-arm64` targets.


To build the library, run the following command:
```
$ angle-builder <target>
```

For the list of all the available options, run:
```
$ angle-builder -h
```
